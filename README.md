Anna University Results Scraper for Schools9.com

Author: Steve Robinson (@stev4nity)

This code uses the Nokogiri parser to parse the results from the results page. The user needs to provide the program 
the results URL and the starting and ending register numbers. The results for all the numbers between the starting
and ending ones will be scrapped and stored to a file called 'results.csv'.

This results.csv file is a simple comma seperated values file which can be opened in any spreadsheet software
including MS Excel.

Any college coming under Anna University can use this software. 

I will port this code to Java and provide a GUI to make it more easy to use when time permits. I would be happy 
if anyone could do this job :)
